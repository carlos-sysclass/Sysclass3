Greeting

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:09,780
A basic greeting  is "Hi!" or "Hello!"

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:25,100
This person here is saying "Hi!"
and this person is saying "Hello!"

22
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:36,000
This is what you say when you greet
somebody or when you meet somebody

23
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,465
Vocabulary

24
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,480
Greeting

25
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:55,820
A greeting can also be "Good morning!"
"GOOD MORNING!"

26
00:03:55,821 --> 00:04:07,450
or "Good afternoon!"
"GOOD AFTERNOON!"

00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:33,050
"good morning" happens in the morning
between 12am and 12 pm

29
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:48,600
"good afternoon" is during the later part of the day
between 12pm and 6pm

30
00:04:48,601 --> 00:05:04,000
and "good evening" is when it starts to get
dark outside at 6pm until 9pm

31
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:17,186
We do not say "good night" as a greeting
We say "good night" when we want to say "good bye"

32
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:23,280
It is the opposite of a greeting

33

Introduction

35
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:37,868
INTRODUCTION

36
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:46,616
An introduction is "my name is..." or "I am..."

37
00:05:47,817 --> 00:05:55,874
For example, "My name is Greg"

38
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,856
My name is Greg

39
00:06:09,857 --> 00:06:23,197
You can also say "I am Greg" or "I'm Greg"

40
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:34,266
When we say I am you can combine "I am" into "I'm"

41
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:38,300
It makes it easier sometimes

42
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:42,116

FORMALITY

45
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:59,195
Some people prefer a more formal introduction

46
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:16,488
I'm Mister Burns.
"Mister" is what we use for all men

47
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:34,203
You can  make "Mister" shorter when you write it
by saying this "Mr."

48
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:40,505
It's Mr. Burns, it's the same thing

49
00:07:43,206 --> 00:07:52,570
for women we say "I am Miss Johnson"
"Miss"

50
00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:59,973
This is for women who are unmarried

51
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:21,667
Unmarried means they do not have a husband
For women who are married we say "Misses"

52
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,064
I'm Misses Smith.

53
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:40,429
This is for women who are married.
Married is that

54
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:54,335
You can make "Misses" shorter by writing this "Mrs."

55
00:08:54,936 --> 00:09:06,080
This is more common than this

56
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:08,902
Ok

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:32,000
A way to respond when somebody
greets you is "Pleased to meet you"

61
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:37,929
or "Nice to meet you"

62
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,500
or "I'm glad to meet you"

63

NICE TO MEET YOU

65

They are the same.
I'M GLAD TO MEET YOU is also the same,

66
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:16,282
but it's not as common.

67
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:23,227
These are more common

68
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:35,000
When somebody asks how you are you can say
"I'm fine, thank you"

69
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:39,380
I'M FINE, THANK YOU

77
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,700
